## With a Template (recommended)

If you already have events to copy:

1. Select a **Template Folder** (source folder)
2. Select a different **Event Folder** (destination)
3. Add your new audio files
4. **Analyze** → tool matches automatically
5. **Import** → events are copied with your new media

---

## Common Issues

**"Please select a destination folder"**
→ Open the "Event Folder" dropdown and select a folder

**"Could not find FMOD Studio executable"**
→ Use the "Browse..." button next to FMOD Studio Executable to locate your FMOD installation

**"FMOD version mismatch detected"**
→ Update FMOD Studio or project to match versions (shown in main UI)

**"Tool doesn't launch"**
→ Ensure Windows 10 or later (64-bit). First launch may take longer.

**Changes don't appear in FMOD**
→ Open FMOD Studio and save the project (Ctrl+S)

## Tips

- Name your files consistently for better matching
- Test first on a small project
- Always backup your FMOD project before importing
- Wait for the progress dialog to complete (don't close it manually)

**💡 Save Time - Configure Default Settings:**
- Click **"Settings"** button (bottom of window) after your first setup
- Save your project path and FMOD executable as defaults
- Next time you launch the tool, everything will be pre-filled automatically!
- Especially useful if you always work on the same project
